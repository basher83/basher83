# **Space-Themed Naming Convention for Homelab Projects**

This naming convention is designed for organizing my homelab projects, using space exploration and astronomy as inspiration. The naming structure includes development, staging, and production projects with a two-part slug format.

## **Naming Convention Format**

- **First Part**: Space mission names (e.g., Apollo, Gemini, Curiosity, etc.)
- **Second Part**: A descriptive term or number, reflecting the project's phase or iteration.

## **Development Projects** (Space Missions + Iteration/Phase)

Development projects are modeled after famous space missions that represent exploration, growth, and discovery. These names are perfect for early-phase, experimental, or exploratory projects.

- **Apollo-1**: First major development milestone.
- **Mercury-2**: The first step, small but crucial.
- **Gemini-3**: Paired projects or collaboration.
- **Voyager-4**: Long-term, exploratory project.
- **Curiosity-5**: Constantly learning and evolving.
- **Challenger-6**: Pushing boundaries, testing new things.
- **Discovery-7**: Seeking new insights and breakthroughs.
- **Atlantis-8**: High-flying innovation.
- **Lunar-9**: Short-term, small-scale project.
- **Columbia-10**: Significant launch or milestone.
- **Endeavour-11**: Long-term, diligent work, continuing effort.

## **Staging Projects** (Planets & Stars + Descriptive Term)

Staging projects are named after planets and stars, representing a transition from development to production. These projects are in an intermediate phase, often more stable, but preparing for the final launch.

- **Saturn-Prime**: A large, stable staging environment.
- **Mars-Alpha**: Ready to land, alpha stage.
- **Jupiter-Beta**: A large and expanding staging project.
- **Sirius-Final**: Final testing before production.
- **Earth-Gamma**: Well-grounded, dependable, and nearing production.
- **Neptune-Beta**: Far-reaching, stable project.
- **Venus-Release**: Highly active, close to production.
- **Rigel-Launch**: Shining bright and strong at the staging level.
- **Capella-Preprod**: Bright, key pre-production star.
- **Aldebaran-Gamma**: Key staging star in the final phase.
- **Uranus-Stable**: Unconventional, but in stable staging.

## **Production Projects** (Galaxies + Strong Descriptor)

Production projects are named after galaxies, representing fully developed, high-performance environments that are stable, expansive, and essential.

- **Andromeda-Core**: Central to operations, vital production system.
- **MilkyWay-Max**: Fully developed, maximum scale, fully operational.
- **Pinwheel-Peak**: High-performance, top-tier production.
- **Sombrero-Edge**: Unique, standout production system.
- **Whirlpool-Prime**: Complex, high-energy, prime production.
- **Virgo-Core**: Massive, critical production environment.
- **Triangulum-Prime**: Growing and expanding production.
- **Leo-Final**: Strong, powerful, and final in production.
- **Laniakea-Edge**: Enormous, far-reaching, cutting-edge production.
- **Hercules-Power**: Robust, powerful, built for performance.
- **Supernova-Vault**: Rapidly expanding, pushing boundaries in production.
